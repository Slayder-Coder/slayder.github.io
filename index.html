        <h2>Vaping has raised significant health concerns due to the presence of multiple harmful chemicals in the aerosol emitted. Studies have revealed that the vapor can contain substances like formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein, which can have detrimental effects on respiratory and cardiovascular health. Additionally, the appeal of flavored e-liquids has led to a rise in youth usage, sparking worries about nicotine addiction and potential gateway to traditional cigarette smoking. While vaping is often considered less harmful than smoking, its long-term consequences are still being studied, urging caution and awareness among users.</h2>
