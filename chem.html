        <h1>So Many Harmful Chemicals What Are They</h1>
        <p>Vaping introduces users to a complex mixture of harmful chemicals. The heating process of e-liquids can produce formaldehyde and acrolein, both of which have adverse health effects. Diacetyl, a flavoring compound associated with the development of "popcorn lung," has been detected in certain e-cigarettes, raising concerns about respiratory health. Additionally, the aerosol produced by vaping contains ultrafine particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs, as well as heavy metals like nickel, tin, and lead, which pose risks to cardiovascular health. Volatile organic compounds found in e-cigarette aerosols further contribute to potential health hazards. As research progresses, a clearer understanding of the full extent of these harmful chemical exposures and their long-term consequences is evolving.</p>
